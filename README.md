Creating a personalized Windows 95-style biography of a Spotify user, displaying their top songs, top artists, amount of friends, and other data pertaining
to their Spotify account

Using Spotipy (https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.22.1/), to access the Spotify Web API in a Python library, Pythons tkinter package to utilize
the Tcl/Tk GUI toolkit, and PyWebView/Flask to tie-in the GUI into a website, we made it so users can generate this view with their own individual
Spotify data
